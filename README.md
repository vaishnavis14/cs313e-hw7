This project explores the minimum number of lines of code that Vyaas must write before taking a break for coffee, utilizing both binary and linear search algorithms for optimization. By implementing these algorithms, the project compares their efficiency in determining the least number of lines necessary based on a specified productivity factor and total lines of code, ultimately providing insights into algorithm performance and coding productivity.
